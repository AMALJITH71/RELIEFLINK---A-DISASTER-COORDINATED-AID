## RELIEFLINK---A-DISASTER-COORDINATED-AID

This project aims to develop a comprehensive disaster management website tailored for state, designed to enhance coordination, communication, and resource management during emergencies. The website will serve as a central hub for coordinating resources, including volunteers, donations, and supplies, to streamline relief efforts and ensure efficient aid distribution. It will also focus on educating the public about disaster preparedness, response strategies, and recovery processes, fostering a proactive approach to community resilience.

Key features of the website will include real-time disaster notifications and daily weather updates for all districts, as well as detailed information on emergency camps, their requirements, and ongoing relief activities. To ensure transparency and accountability in financial transactions, the platform will leverage blockchain technology to record all donations, preventing fraud and ensuring that each transaction is traceable.

By integrating these features, the website will not only facilitate immediate disaster response and recovery but also empower communities to be better prepared for future emergencies. This project represents a significant step towards creating a safer, more resilient state, equipped to handle the challenges posed by natural and man-made disasters.

SHORT DESCRIPTION

## MOTIVATION AND PROBLEM STATEMENT

- *Communication gap* in disaster zones often leads to delays in rescue and relief.  
- *Fragmented resource management*, where supplies and volunteers are inefficiently allocated.  
- No centralized *reporting or tracking system* for incidents or donations.  
- Vulnerable areas lack real-time visibility into weather, infrastructure, and needs.  

ReliefLink aims to resolve these by offering a unified dashboard for real-time coordination and transparent tracking of relief efforts.
